# ðŸ“˜ Water Quality Determiner
This project uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to determine water quality based on chemical and biological indicators. It can be applied to environmental monitoring and public health decision-making.

## Features
- Preprocessing of water quality datasets.
- Statistical analysis of chemical/biological water indicators.
- Machine learning model to classify water as safe or unsafe.
- Visualizations to highlight trends in water quality parameters.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
Clone this repository:
> git clone https://github.com/acexedo/water-quality-determiner.git

Navigate into the folder:
> cd water-quality-determiner

Install the dependencies

## Usage
Run the notebook:
> jupyter notebook water_quality.ipynb

The workflow includes preprocessing, analysis, and classification steps.

## Results
The project provides a classification system that flags water samples as "safe" or "unsafe" based on predefined quality metrics. Useful for policymakers, researchers, and environmental monitoring.
